# Installation

### Download Binary

TODO: Add instructions for using our pre-built binaries.

### Build From Source

To build from source, you will need to install Rust and the Wasm target. We recommend using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) to install Rust and Cargo.

Then, use the instructions from the git README to build the project.
