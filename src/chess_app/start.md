# Start From Template

This guide will walk you through building a very simple chess app on Uqbar. The final result will look like this: https://github.com/uqbar-dao/uqbar/tree/main/modules/chess. We've included it in the basic runtime distribution so you can try it out yourself.

Use the environment setup guide [here](../my_first_app/chapter_1.md) to get ready for this tutorial. Once you have the template app installed, and can see it running in your testing node, continue to [chess engine](./chess_engine.md)...
