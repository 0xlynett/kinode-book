# Chapter 1: Environment Setup

TODO

## Install Rust
- ...

## Build an Uqbar node from source, or download a pre-built binary
- ...

## Run the node on the ETH Sepolia testnet
- get some sepolia tokens
- use the registration page to make a new .uq identity on the testnet
- optionally, spin up more nodes if you want to test your app on the network

## Clone the template repo and install it on your node
- https://github.com/uqbar-dao/uqdev
- ...

## Open the template app in your editor
- install `rust-analyzer` for best experience
- install copilot extension

## Start watching the template app and installing it on your node on-change
- make this a script in `uqdev`
- it watches your /pkg folder and hits the app_store install message on change!
